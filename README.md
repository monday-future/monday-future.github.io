### What do You Want to Make Real?


Monday Morning Homepage is an ongoing prototype exploring imaginative frameworks surrounding climate change. When the facts of reality paint a picture of severe global collapse, we need to find a way to cultivate hope for the future, for our species, and for our planet.

This website is a digital artifact from a better, but possible future. The same way a newspaper from the past gives us a glimpse into the goings-on and lives of its moment, Monday Morning Homepage is a window into the lives of a world where we adapted to and overcame the climate crisis.

Much like change in the real world, this website centers the local actions and happenings within a community. How can we take some of the concepts we see here and apply them to our own worlds?

i hope your monday is going well,
