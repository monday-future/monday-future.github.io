                                    <em>Monday Morning Homepage</em> is an ongoing prototype exploring imaginative
                                    frameworks surrounding climate change. When the facts of reality
                                    paint a picture of severe global collapse, we need to find a way to
                                    cultivate hope for the future, for our species, and for our planet.

                                    and lives of its moment, <em>Monday Morning Homepage</em> is a window into the lives
                                    of a world where we adapted to and overcame the climate crisis.

                                        The planning committee is trying to take us back to the stone age! Using an old mall for library operations is just going to bring us back to the kind of consumerism that we worked so hard to kick!!

                                            Malls once provided non-consumer services. Places to meet and socialize offline, easy access to food and drink, a group activity. We have the capacity to support an operation like this. Not being consumerist doesn’t mean we have to live ascetic lives.

                                    <strong>August 16, 2085</strong> – A pressing buzzing fills the air in the brand new Las
                                    Amigas Jardineras neighborhood designed by the rockstar city planning firm,
                                    Ayacucho STEPS. This neighborhood represents the bleeding edge of global
                                    urban design. Wind-catchers fan out into the sky, following complex,
                                    computer-generated curves. Citrus and olive trees are pain-stakingly coaxed
                                    along narrow, walkable, city streets. The ground is slightly spongy
                                    underfoot, a mix of ground-up automobile tires and genetically engineered
                                    mycelium designed to self-heal by filtering microplastics out of runoff. On
                                    a sweltering 110 degree day, the temperature on the shaded streets of Las
                                    Amigas is 78 degrees with absolutely zero electricity use. Yet, despite the
                                    world-class design and over 2000 residents, we saw almost nobody on the
                                    street. Las Amigas Jardineras has a huge problem: mosquitos.

                                    Tucson municipal planning directive 7 outlines the guidelines for selecting
                                    a community development proposal during the procurement process.
                                    Sub-section 7.1.1 states the following:
                                </p>
                                <ol style="padding-left: 2.5em;">

                                            Limiting lifetime greenhouse gas emissions per housed person must
                                            be a priority during the selection process of the assigned planning
                                            committee,
                                        </p>
                                    </li>

                                            and any positive lifetime greenhouse gas emissions must directly

                                            significant excess to the great, societal cost of those emissions.

                                    In practice, proving “value in significant excess” is very difficult
                                    outside the medical and military fields. This public directive forces a
                                    type of lowest–bidder process regarding carbon, in the planning committees.
                                    Over the past 48 years since municipal secession, nine different public
                                    proposals have unsuccessfully attempted to amend this directive to allow
                                    greater flexibility for public comfort. Yet, our society still seems
                                    unready to make such a change. The societal trauma of our grandparent’s
                                    climate crisis runs very, very deep.

                                    In the final selection process for the development, two main design firms
                                    presented competing proposals. The Pascua Yaqui tribal corporation,
                                    Planificadores de un Futuro Mejor en el nombre de nuestro Señor de Los
                                    Milagros (PFM), and the world-renowned Medellín-based design union Ayacucho
                                    STEPS. PFM’s proposal involved neo-native pueblo-type designs, along with
                                    several open-source Iranian windcatcher designs specifically designed with
                                    the desert in mind. PFM representatives also correctly predicted the
                                    potential issues with mosquitos that Ayacucho would face. According to the
                                    planning committee’s final report, PFM’s proposal represented a “more
                                    realistic, sustainable, and diverse quality of life” than the Columbian
                                    designer’s union could ever offer.
                                </p>
                                <br/>
                                <p dir="ltr">
                                    Yet, Ayacucho STEPS still won the proposal on the grounds that it had 47%
                                    lower greenhouse emissions than that of PFM. Unfortunately, PFM’s
                                    methane-powered rammed-earth construction equipment needed to be shipped by
                                    road from Santa-Fe. PFM needed most of their production to be performed
                                    locally, without the efficiency of economies of scale. Ten years ago, their
                                    proposal would have been very carbon-competitive, but the world has changed
                                    with the introduction of global rock-star design firms.
                                </p>

                                <p dir="ltr">
                                    Ayacucho prefabricates the buildings in Tegucigalpa, cultivates the GMO
                                    mycelium in Shenzhen, force-grows the olive trees in Brasília, and
                                    3d-prints the wind catchers in Düsseldorf. Everything ships in on electric
                                    trains and wingsail cargo ships. Modern global supply lines like this
                                    eerily echo the days of wanton consumption and unfettered capitalism;
                                    plastic toys and gadgets shipped across the world in giant diesel-powered
                                    ships and fleets of dirty trucks, only to be briefly used and shipped back
                                    as trash to the neo-colonized nation states.

                                    Yet despite how it feels emotionally, holistic economic science shows us that the vast global networks of wingsail cargo
                                    ships, solar trains, and packet-blimps *can* have significantly lower emissions and resource use than doing things
                                    locally. But this isn’t the whole story, we have to ask what it means for new-society when our social policies
                                    increasingly encourage centralized thinking. Local sourcing brings resilience and adaptation to the unique realities of
                                    our ecosystems and environments. Ayacucho STEPS is working on 8 different design projects outside of their biome. Their
                                    artistry, efficiency, and expertise is world class. But we can’t expect designers in Medellín to understand the unique
                                    ways that our desert would interact with their work better than a design firm staffed predominantly native peoples who
                                    have lived on this land since ancient times. What we gain in carbon-efficiency by outsourcing, we lose in local wisdom.

                                    It is well understood that public policy must be made with care for the complexities of the human ecosystem. However,
                                    carbon regulations are often exceptions to these guidelines. The rigidity and asceticism with which we’ve driven
                                    emissions down has brought us to a safer place on this Earth. But strict, straightforward rules often bring us towards
                                    patterns that we neither want nor expect. Patterns like neo-globalization. We ought to bring holistic ecological
                                    considerations to our carbon-policy and try to consider the myriad effects of a single action in a complex world. We
                                    ought to consider the mosquitos.
